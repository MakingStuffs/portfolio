      <h5>What is JavaScript?</h5>
      <p>
        JavaScript is often described as a fully fledged programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In layman's terms that basically means that it is a coding language
        which is used by multiple machines and provides all the functionality
        you would expect from a programming language.
      </p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>To put it as simply as possible: pretty much everything.</p>
      <p>
        With the release of tools such as NodeJS JavaScript is capable of
        handling every aspect of application and website development, from the
        server to the browser.

      <h5>What is CSS?</h5>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a type of style sheet language.</p>
      <p>
        It was created to enable developers to alter the way markup languages
        (such as HTML) are displayed on devices such as computers.
      </p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, it is used for altering the appearance of markup
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without CSS web pages and web apps would simply be boring black and
        white text documents which are displayed on your screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its invention CSS has been enhanced to enable developers to use it
        as a solution for a multitude of problems including animations and
        responsive design.

      <h5>What is SCSS?</h5>
      <p>SCSS is what is known as a preprocessor for CSS.</p>
      <p>
        This basically means that SCSS is somewhat like an addon for the CSS
        language and provides a number of additional features.
      </p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>As with CSS, SCSS is used to add styling to web pages.</p>
      <p>
        The difference between CSS and SCSS is that CSS can be directly read by
        your browser whereas SCSS needs to first be compiled into CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the most basic of explanations, SCSS is used to create more advanced
        CSS files.

      <p>It can be seen as the blueprint to any website/webapp.</p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>
        The purpose of HTML5 is to structure and then present data on the world
        wide web (internet).
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides web browsers with all the data which is to be displayed on
        your browsing device and gives some basic instruction as to the
        importance/hierarchy of data being presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        While HTML is a text based markup language, the invent of HTML5 and the

      <h5>What is PHP?</h5>
      <p>
        Much like JavaScript, PHP is a programming language. However, unlike
        JavaScript, PHP can only be executed on the server itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP files can contain JavaScript, CSS and HTML, and will output plain
        HTML to the browser. Although they do not <em>have</em> to.
      </p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, PHP is used on the server. It can be used to
        dynamically render HTML webpages, handle user authentication and pretty
        much anything else you'd expect of a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is used almost religiously for larger dynamic websites and is what
        powers the world's leading content management system: WordPress.

      </p>
      <h5>What is it Used For?</h5>
      <p>
        Generally speaking it used to execute tasks on a server. These tasks
        could be anything from getting an image to serve to a user, to writing a
        new user's login credentials to a database.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gained popularity among many developers due to the fact that it
        allows us write full applications using one single language: JavaScript.

      <p>
        React's biggest use case is for creating highly performant user
